I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe?
Do you believe in the magic of love?
I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe?
Do you believe in the magic of love?

When there's no love in your life
Days feel long, you're all alone
And life waves you bye-bye
You close the door to your heart
Don't want to let the pain in yet
You're always on your guard
But when the love birds start to sing
You hear bells start to ring
And you feel it's happening

I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe?
Do you believe in the magic of love?
I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe?
Do you believe in the magic of love?

When there's no love in your home
You're on the street so incomplete
You're out on your own
You'll meet some just along for the ride
But you know where they're coming from
Let your conscience be your guide
But when the day comes the night goes
When your hate stops your love flows
Stimulation in an overload

I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe?
Do you believe in the magic of love?
I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe?
Do you believe in the magic of love?

I can feel it in my heart
I feel the power of the hour
A sensation celebration
I can feel it
Feel it in my soul, my soul
Feel the magic all around you
Now that love has found your life

I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe?
Do you believe in the magic of love?
I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe?
Do you believe in the magic of love?

I believe...
